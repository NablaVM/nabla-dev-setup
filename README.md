# Dev Detup

To make working on Nabla :star2: *SUPER* :star2: easy I've created this repo that will host some scripts to get development rolling. 

To start, run ***install_cpputest***. The only real thing that Nabla depends on is CPPUTest, unless, you decided to turn off the tests... then you won't need to install it. 

Once CPPUTest is installed, all you have to do is run ***setup-env***. You will be prompted for a directory path to create and install everything in. The script will pull all of the Nabla repos there,
and generate a build directory and a build script that will build/install libnabla and then build Solace and the Nabla Application.
